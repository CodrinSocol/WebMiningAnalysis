Updated review","So yesterday my husband a couple other dad's showed up during late lunch no reservations, which I tell you is never a good idea especially when you need a table for 10! We requested ancient Orange section but the poor girl was totally full not one seat open in her section so yes of course we were disappointed but ancient Orange talk to the hostess and found us a table in Germany, thank you Agent Orange! The kids were disappointed but were extremely grateful that they were able to be seated agent orange promised that she would come by the table and see them when she had a chance. I don't know how she did it because according to my husband the place was packed but she made time for all the kids. Now you know why she's our favorite server she is a gem. We love you agent Orange!

I remember as a young child living in a small town, my parents made the exciting trip to the big city to go out with some friends.  When they returned from the SafeHouse, they were giddy and tipsy, and also confided in us children the secret password. Of course I committed it to memory.Years later I had a chance to visit, but to be honest it was a little blurry- I came away with the general impression that it was grimy and didn't smell very nice.When I heard that it was bought and being reopened, I wondered if it would be anything like my parents remembered if I got a chance to go visit again. Would the new owners gut it completely? Can't say I would have necessarily blamed them.Instead I was surprised and excited to see that they basically kept all of the original pieces, structures, themes and contraptions with some updates. They did a really nice job of cleaning it up, while somehow preserving its history.On top of that it's really family friendly now, which I love!!!

He had picked out one that was slathered in jalapeños and other goodies which after tasting his, really did improve upon the grade school cafeteria meat we were eating. Still if I'm going to indulge in a burger, I'd rather eat a better quality meat. I gave them two stars because I haven't tried much more of the menu and I like the atmosphere of the place. Also the fried pickles were actually pretty tasty. Maybe I went on an off night?",189,984,M L.,"Milwaukee, WI",0,2,0,1

Most importantly though, they have bartenders with man-buns that usually wear tanktops, when I am out to have a good time and a few drinks this is one of the most important things I look for as far as atmosphere in a bar/pub locale. I also enjoy the fact that they do not have table service, it allows me to get that little extra bit of exercise that helps burn off the calories every time I venture from the table I am at to the bar a mere 3 to 10 feet away (depending on whether you are indoors or on the beautiful outdoor patio). No doubt John Revord and his brilliant staff of knowledgeable bartenders and bar backs created every thing this brilliant establishment includes for specific reasons, some of which are pertaining to things I mentioned above.

Updated review",Third time is not a charm. I was in the mood for some wings and came back to give them another chance. Was expecting a lot more after the owner had reached out to me about my first yelp review. The service is non existent and it seems that all the workers are more interested in hanging out with each other then taking care there tables. Its more like Who's in charge! I had to ask for refills every time and even had to ask for the check to escape this place. The wings are not good. I see all these yelp reviews about good wings and I get excited to eat them but they have been different all 3 times I have been here now. Must be different cooks or something. Cheese curds are good but you can get cheese cards everywhere in milwaukee. No wonder it the most lifeless bar on the street!,155,787,Sarah J.,"Milwaukee, WI",0,16,0,1

THE BEER (4 stars): A nice mix of various styles, with stronger offerings such as local staple Riverwest Stein, summer weiss Wisconsinite, and amber ale Fixed Gear. Gluten-free offering New Grist not exciting. THE TOUR (4 stars): My original favorite Milwaukee-area brewery tour. Healthy samples, opportunity for group song, festive environment. Definitely most fun with a large group. THE FISH FRY (3 stars): Used to be one of the best in town, but recently the brewery took ownership of the food prep. I prefer lightly-breaded perch, but the new recipe is heavy breading with an off flavor that really masks the perch. Atmosphere is lively and polka music a lot of fun.

Updated review","Tl:dr Rat Pack inspired cocktail lounge serving old school drinks, & ice-cream drinks. At Random is from an era that is, & should be a part of our soul.Somethings in life, love, & business should not change. Why reinvent the one thing that works best? Unless...I'll tell you more later, or if you take me out to At Random. It's an old school cocktail bar in one of the progressive neighborhoods of Milwaukee called Bay View (alongwith Riverwest, Wauwatosa, Third Ward, Fifth Ward, Walker's Point). It used to be the place to bring a date in many years ago, & it still is. Because sometimes somethings shouldn't change like that. Service: if it's your first time, then you will likely be walking in not knowing what to expect. Maybe you rarely drink like I do (I'm much more of a taster of many drinks, than drinking one entire libation). Although, I try to learn as much as I can about perfecting cocktails for friends. You may or may not order virgin drinks, if it's your first time, & trust me Like A Virgin will not be blaring loudly, it'll be something from Frank Sinatra or Nat King Cole, & really something from the Rat Pack induced goodness. You will be greeted by deep darkness, & merriment concurrently as the hostess usually merry as ever seats you in old fashioned charm. The drinks: The menu is the same. No need to improve on perfection. Grasshopper, Mai Tai... The decor: it is extremely tacky, but why would you have it any other way? It's fittingly appropriate for a time with a new sense of commercialism, speed, & futuristic thinking. There are fake plants, flowers, silver garlands, poinsetta lights, & vinyl booths, with two seater booths for a rendezvous in silence, or in shameless conversation. There has been talk that the owners want to sell this long established gem of a spot, but we can only hope that you'll employ your grandmother here. Ever visited Enoteca Maria's in Staten Island? If not, you all should. All the employees are nonnas, or Italian grandmothers. They have gone with international themed foods with a much broader concept, as they now offer ""Nonnas of the World"" (!) in addition to their Italian grandmothers, they now have grandmother chefs from Sri Lanka, Philippines, Japan, Algeria, Moscow, etc., etc., etc. How fabulous is this??? You can check their Nonnas of the World Calendar on their website to see which grandmother is cooking on which day. Such should be a random take over of At Random to employ our older generation an outlet to partaaaaay! The more some things change, the more At Random stays the same. And, that's endearing.",451,2587,Hiro Y.,"Seattle, WA",741,154,3301,1

I work at a bar myself, and I've always been a sucker for a place that has a horse shoe bar.That being said, the place over all was a joke.I got my first drink fairly quickly and started a tab. Once finished, I ordered my second one after a 20 minute wait.It was not that busy and somehow the bartender forgot about me, so after a fairly decent wait I got his attention again and reordered.He then proceeded to refill my drink in my rocks glass over my melted ice water and not fill the glass. I was drinking double jack and cokes all night.When I asked to settle my tab immediately after he poured me that drink, the bartender asked me for the spelling of my last night three seperate times. When he finally came back with my credit card, my tab, for two double jack and cokes, was $20.Now, like I said I work at a bar a block away, that cocktail would cost you $7 over by us, not $10 each. Also, even in downtown Milwaukee (Water Street) that cocktail would not cost that much.Also, I don't mind paying for extra service and everything like that, but his lack of attention, forgetting my order, and then finally, to be hit with a tab like that after only two drinks (one and a half if you ask me), that really set me off.My first fifteen minutes there, listening to the live band (which was fabulous) and hanging out was fantastic and I was ready to recommend it to people. But in about an hours worth of time, it completely ruined itself for me.Maybe it was an off night? Or the bartender himself was having an off night.Be it as it may, I highly recommend you second guess your choice if you're looking for a bar for a date night if this is the type of service they're going to provide. There are a lot of cheaper options in this city for that, after all, it's Milwaukee.",413,2169,Bud J.,"Cudahy, WI",0,1,0,0

When I called Matt back, he apologized and said that the was going to try and make it right and promised to send a gift card  so that we would try Fools Errand on another evening.  I then scrambled and was eventually able to get into a Walker's Point restaurant.  After having boasted to the clients about being able to walk to dinner, we ended up having to drive and sitting down over an hour later than planned.  That was July 15th.  Do you think that I ever received the promised gift card?  Nope.  I guess that I am the fool.",311,1733,David M.,"Milwaukee, WI",0,1,0,0

I've normally had fun times at the High Note Lounge each time I've been there these last few years, but I was recently at the High Note Lounge, and I unfortunately had a bad experience there this time. The High Note Lounge hired new bartenders who were very unfriendly and disrespectful. When I was there recently, I did my usual stand up comedy set, and during karaoke, one of the bartenders who was also working at the door asked me to step outside. He asked me to stay away from women and touching them inappropriately, but I did not do any inappropriate touches with anyone I interacted with at the bar. All I did was make eye contact and have a friendly smile with them while dancing to some of the music. When I tried to explain that to the bartender, he did not believe me and he creeped me out when he told me that he's been observing me all night. I then went back in and sat down at the bar and stayed away from dancing. And then when it was my turn to sing another song for karaoke, I went up and sang and did what I normally do on the stage, but then after the song ended and I sat back down at the bar, another new bartender lady who was also working at the door told me that I needed to leave immediately. The bartenders misinterpreted me and told me that they thought I was making other people uncomfortable, but no one I interacted with talked to me about that directly. If they had talked to me directly and asked me to stop doing something I didn't realize I was doing, I would have listened to them. The bartender threatened me and told me that I have to leave in the next 2 minutes after I was trying to gather all my belongings and get out the door. The bartender even grabbed my jacket from my chair before I even had a chance to put it on and she forced me outside before I even put my jacket on. Rushing someone out the door like that is rude and disrespectful. I think the High Note Lounge could be better staffed by more friendly and understanding bartenders and people working at the door and people who understand other people's perspectives and not only theirs. Because of the bad experience I had at the bar that I've never had before, I unfortunately don't feel safe coming back to the High Note Lounge again. I do not recommend this bar especially if you don't want to be put in a tough situation with the bartenders like I was recently in. It is not worth it.",481,2515,Jeremy W.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,19,6,0

Her knowledge of the menu and ability to anticipate our needs added such a personal touch to the evening.The food at Oak Barrel was nothing short of exceptional. While everything we tried was fantastic, the cheese curds were the undeniable highlight. They were perfectly crispy on the outside and deliciously gooey on the inside, with just the right amount of seasoning. Paired with ranch, they were absolutely irresistible. The rest of our meal was equally impressive, with each dish prepared to perfection and presented beautifully. It's clear the kitchen takes pride in their work.The cozy yet vibrant ambiance of Oak Barrel rounded out the experience, making it the perfect spot for a memorable meal. Between the amazing service and the outstanding food--especially those unforgettable cheese curds--it's a place I'll definitely be returning to. I've already started recommending it to friends, and I can't wait to visit again soon!",208,1283,Danielle H.,"Bronzeville, Milwaukee, WI",0,1,0,0

I got a smashed Peanut Butter and Jam burger. It was the perfect amount of spicy and sweet and savory for me. The Nashville hot fries were perfectly seasoned. (I'm not a huge fan of spicy things, these were very mild for spicy so that was perfect for me.) Overall I recommend stopping in. Even if it is just for a drink because the bar is also great.

Came to MKE for a quick getaway from Chicago and so incredibly happy to stumble upon Oak Barrel. Came in on a busy Saturday night (big name concert in town didn't help!) but were greeted by friendly faces and sat right away. Immediately upon sitting we were given a small bag of bacon fat popcorn. My husband and I had to fight our 3 year old for it.  It was a perfect little salty starter. Cheese curds for mom and dad and a grilled cheese for the little one soon followed. Awesome move removing the crusts off the grilled cheese - toddler gave it a big high five (..way better than a yelp 5 star review!). Curds were absolute light crispy little bites of perfection.  The star was the Dynamite Chicken Mac and Cheese.  Wow!! Crispy, cheesy, perfectly spicy.  We're still talking about it!Service was great and the manager was seen multiple times around the place checking in on everyone and helping his staff.

Updated review","I've been traveling a lot for business and when I'm in Milwaukee, I stop in. I usually stop in during the late evening hours. The beer selection is outstanding and the food is on point. However, what really keeps me coming back is the bartender. Her name is Ty and she's a bundle of joy and smarts when it comes to beers. She's always so happy and very accommodating to your needs. Shes always interested in your day prior to stopping in. There's also this group of younger gentlemen who seem to always be there. A very nice, inviting group of diverse young men that you wouldn't expect to see. I believe two of theirs names are Ryan and Josh. Their is always laughter and good times to be had when they are all huddled around the bar. This is a true gem of Milwaukee Wisconsin!!",146,779,Matthew W.,"Milwaukee, WI",0,1,0,1

The patio is broken up into several seating areas separated by small plantings that create nicely appointed human scaled spaces. Visually, this space is anchored by a couple tear drop shaped bamboo chairs hung from an overhang connected to the main building.The main building is home to the largest of three indoor spaces and includes a near 40Ft long glazed wooden bar with a continuation of wooden trusses overhead and dark subway tile as a backdrop. They offer a great selection (20+?) of beers & adult beverages on tap.Booths & tables with oversized oak barrels to sit within, provide a backdrop similarly seen in many old brewery storage tunnels used to keep beers cold back in the day.The smaller building is across from the main building & split up into two rooms. The first is a retail / tasting room located towards the front of the property & has a massive selection of bottled & canned beers / cocktails / wines offered to go. The second room is towards the back of the property adjacent to the rear patio and is a perfect escape for a private venue.There is an open courtyard towards the front of Draft & Vessel that provides great outdoor seating and a perfect perch for people watching as folks walk to & from the Village.They don't offer food but did design a ramp that provides space enough for a food truck to roll up & into the open courtyard.

And I still do love the concept, and the lights and the cool people.. Then they got busted for letting underage Marquetties in..Then they started using some weird app to Google patrons to determine if they are 21 or not. My friends and I get told we can't come in and five seconds later that we can, once we pull out 4 different forms of ID.While the people watching is great, when I came in last Saturday for my friends birthday party some crazy woman who must have been on steroids was roaming the dance floor pushing people to the ground while her huge boyfriend egged her on. When she got to me she must have gotten mad when I didn't fall to the floor and decided to throw a sloppy punch that ended up with a finger in my  eyeball. When I did fall to the floor the bouncers stood around for about a minute. Then they rushed toward me but my friends were already helping me so I encouraged them to go after the crazy woman who had been assaulting people. As she escaped out the door what did the bouncers do? Stood there looking shell-shocked while everyone around me yelled ""go get them!"". If I had wanted to call the police it would not have done any good because the bouncers seemed to be purposely inactive to avoid a police presence. Your guess is as good as mine. While the other patrons who had been pushed came to my aid and angrily asked why nothing had been done the bouncers did what ? stood around looking shell-shocked. To put the cherry on top our less than stellar waitress had put drinks on our tab that didn't belong to us and over charged my card for something I didn't order. Victor you are a great guy.

We have both eaten at Victor's for many years. The food was good, as usual. We especially love the loaf of baked bread that comes with every meal. But we noticed something unusual when the bill arrived. We had asked the server to split it in half and we were each paying with a credit card. We both like to pay the food amount with plastic and then pay the server's tip in cash (we both are generous tippers for good service, usually 20%). The two cash register receipts (each for half the total amount for the bill) were stapled on top of a carbon copy of the server's hand-written bill. So we each signed our copies and put down a 20% gratuity in cash (though we could also have written the tip on the cash register copies we signed). Luckily before the server took the receipts and cash tip we looked under the stapled receipts and found that the server had already added an 18% tip to the bill and had rung up the total due with that included. So in essence we would have tipped twice had we not noticed. Needless to say we quickly re-pocketed our cash. We were not happy with this ""little trick."" Is it even legal to write a gratuity on a bill for only two people? And should the server have alerted us to the practice, as it certainly was not printed on the menu? What if we chose to tip 15%?All this leaves a bad taste, and we certainly will think twice about going back.In the end the server got less, as we would have tipped 20%.

Seriously, it was amazing. We hadn't been there in some time because we generally only go for our birthdays which fall in late August and mid September. When we got there this time, the hostesses were too busy chit chatting with each other to seat us. When they finally noticed us, we were given a table and the standard dining experience started. Our waitress was nice. We didn't see our favorite item (our reason for coming) on the menu and were told it was removed long ago. We moved on and ordered the fish fry and the ceasar salad. It was my boyfriend's birthday so he eagerly bit into his fish which was breaded and fried cod. It was cold and pink in the middle. Biting into the raw fish turned his stomach and made him ill. The waitress was kind enough to have the cooks make a whole new plate but honestly, it was too late. My boyfriend is not the type to complain so I politely asked to speak to the manager who seemed less than concerned about our negative experience. A comp would have been nice, but an apology wasn't even given. The manager seemed irritated that I asked to speak with him. Very bland salad and raw fish... with a rude manager who made me feel like I was wasting his time by politely informing him of the raw fish means we most likely will not be returning.

I can't say enough about this place! Aside from the obvious... BEER (80 taps and over 100 bottles, with new ones added daily!?) there are so many other reasons my wife and I visit at least twice a week. I'll start with the atmosphere. As I already said, my wife and I visit at least twice a week. Usually Mondays for trivia and Friday or Saturday, occasionally enjoying live music. I've also had a few business lunch meetings during the week. Lastly, ""The Tap"" has become my go-to for Packer games, due to the free TD shots and Jersey giveaways. I can't think of any other place in town that I can enjoy myself for 3 completely different purposes. It's really an all-purpose tavern. That brings me to my next topic... the service. No matter if it's a packed house on Friday night, or a handful of people eating lunch on a Wednesday afternoon, we've always received prompt, friendly service. I don't know where they find these bartenders, but the knowledge they have of beer, local breweries or international ones, is impressive to say the least. The servers must be treated well, because they legitimately look happy to be there. Which is more than I can say for a lot of the national chains in the area. The owner is frequently behind the bar or taking tables, and, although I'm embarrassed to say I can't remember his name :/, he always, no matter how busy, takes time to stop and welcome us back. I've heard a couple employees say that he even does dishes when the kitchen gets backed up (what OWNER does that!?) On to the best part.. THE FOOD!!! I can't decide if my favorite is the prime rib sandwich, the fish fry, or the chicken tenders. The latter two have been revamped recently with the new menu (I'll get to that). They batter them in house in a beer batter. I've tried to squeeze the recipe out of some employees but either they don't know, or aren't telling. They rolled out a new menu a couple months ago that is quite diverse. They've added some healthier options like a Quinoa dish and lettuce wraps to name a few, my wife is into that kind of thing, I'll stick with the more traditional options. Almost forgot the burgers. I was always a Red Robin fan and I prefer them here. I recommend the Pub.I didn't plan to be this long winded, but this place is doing everything right.

We drove up from Chicago and spent the weekend. I previously heard some positive things about the place and wanted to give it a shot. Unfortunately, this was by far the worst concert venue I've ever been to. I think any individual that actually gives this dump a positive review has never truly experienced a good concert. First off, the acoustics are horrible, absolutely awful. Vocals were nearly impossible to pick up. I understand you can make the argument that it's an old building, but the right amount of money and technology will fix anything. At $5 a 6oz water and $9 a beer, you would think the venue would have enough money to upgrade.  We purchased ""VIP"" balcony tickets. The fine print stated that the balcony seats were first come first serve. We understood that and arrived early only to find that there were no seats available. About 60% of the seats we're reserved, which was not stated when purchasing the tickets. So the venue sells these ""VIP"" balcony tickets but then reserves most of the seats. We tried to speak with the box office and security staff to see how to purchase these reserved seats and they had no idea, all I received were blank dumbfounded looks and answers like ""they're reserved"". Yeah, no shit, all I want to know if it's possible to purchase a section. Also, if you're going to charge me $5 for water, actually pour me the entire bottle. I ordered two bottles, the ""bartender"" poured barely one and a half of them into two small cups. I proceeded to grab the remaining half filled bottle to finish it, and she snatched it from me like I was a maniac. She said I couldn't have it, I guess a half filled plastic bottle was a danger to other concertgoers. I'm used to spending money on concerts and understand mark up costs, but this lacked common sense.The Rave is a heaping pile of garbage that should be remodeled or torn down completely.

Fuck it right in its carny ass. If you like this place, you're either stupid or from out of town. If you're at this place, you're either stupid, from out of town, work there (sorry), or the band you came to see is too stupid to book at a venue that doesn't feel like a trailer park was shaken over it and everything that fell out filled the place to its claustrophobic limit. Hey, want to get in the show for free? There are always free tickets all over town! And in your mail box! And under your windshield wipers! What's that you say? Two drink minimum? No problem. The Chicago Syndicate owners have seen fit to only charge you $11 per drink. How nice of them! Good luck pissing if you're a guy. They have approximately 1 urinal for every 64,000 concertgoers. I imagine it's not much better for the ladies, but if you're a lady, you shouldn't be at The Rape/Eagles Club. Go home. Or to Victor's. It's less likely you'll get roophied there. The security staff fucking hates you. They will feel up your underbits looking for your flask, pipe, or switchblade that you were going to stab DJ Funk with. Don't worry, there's plenty of parking in the safe, well-lit neighborhood surrounding The Rape. No more than 3 friends have had their windows smashed and stereos ripped off, so your odds are pretty good. The cops LOVE to come help you out at the edge of the hood after a few thousand drunks pour into the streets, so make sure you call them if/when your car gets got. They'll be there in a jiffy! One thing I'll share, if you're sneaky, you can find an unlocked door on the balcony level of the ballroom when the shows are downstairs. After you come down from the roof after your smoke break, wait till the stoned high school dropout security guard by the pissers fucks off for whatever reason. Jump the half-assed barrier stopping you from going out onto the balcony. Start opening doors (be quiet). You can find your way to the catwalk above the ceiling, it's cool.  There may be bodies or drugs or cash stashed up there, who knows? Also, the far stairs on the other side of the balcony will lead you directly to the backstage area of The Rape. There's fucking tape arrows on the floor that say ""back stage"" and ""busses"".

Previous review","I've been to the Rave twice, once 2 years ago to see Primus and this past Saturday to see Korn.  Let me also add that my boyfriend and I live in Charlotte, NC and have flown both times to see these bands b/c neither were coming anywhere near us.  The Primus show was overall great and we were on the floor.  This time he paid BIG $$$ to have VIP seats on the upper level so we'd have actual seats.  We arrived an hour early to get drinks and veg b4 the show only to discover there were only about 100 VIP seats for first come arrivals for well over 1,000 people even though we had seat numbers printed on our tix and no warning about getting there early to secure an actual seat.  AND, the dumbass owner had 2 sections, right in the front middle RESERVED for him and his friends.  The opening band was so bad that the crowd was screaming at them to get off the stage, in much more graphic terms though, and Korn went on at least an hour after the opening band had ended their set.  (Seriously Jonathan?  Are you really that much of a prima donna or were you busy getting blow-jobs in the back?)  His vocals were drowned out and if you didn't actually know the words to their songs you'd have no idea what he was singing.  Lastly, it was so freaking hot in that place that it was like a portal to HELL and I had to call paramedics for my boyfriend that started having medical issues because of the heat, lack of seating and possibly kidney probs.  WE WILL NEVER GO BACK NOR WILL MANY OF THE PEOPLE THAT WERE AROUND US THAT WE TALKED WITH THAT FELT THE SAME WAY!!!  Oh and to the blond 'security' guard that thought he was the shit in the VIP section, telling people to not crowd the people that actually got a place to sit b/c they would need to get up to get drinks, GET A REAL JOB!!!  I'm not a violent person but you were seriously close to getting a beat-down for your very rude and uncool attitude!",368,1902,Tiffany M.,"Union, NC",0,1,0,0

Previous review","This place really sucks, I am sorry, why the fuck are miller lites $7.50?!?!?!?! And mixed rails are $8???? Who is in charge of pricing drinks, Bernie Madoff?Also why the hell are the bouncers so stupid? I worked the door at a couple places, worked with some real yams, but these guys were tator tots. You can't remember I was just upstairs and now I am going downstairs? I hate shitty bouncers, the job is so easy. And they did nothing to stop illegal behavior from happening. Not that I am trying to narc or anything, but dude, your like 5 deep in the entrance where nobody is chilling but upstairs (which is pretty awesome BTW) where there are 50+ 19 year olds doing whipits, there is no fat moron with an orange security shirt.But the only reason this place gets 2 stars instead of 1 is the cool ass upstairs on the roof area. Its is realy nice, all stone 2 un covered areas for smokers, and a bar. There was a killer dance floor where I shook my ass. But everything else sucks, seriously, including the neighborhood. I never go the sense that I was going to get robbed, but I did feel like the element hanging outside have been preying on white kids from Wisco & their cars for decades, so that may be a problem the Milwaukee PD should handle, but I digress.Everything else sucks. The schedule was so hard to understand I almost missed the godamn headliner. I feel bad for those living in Milwaukee, cuz this is probably the biggest place around & the only exposure a lot of people get to Wisco.

What can I say about you? I've been attending shows here for over 6 years and have yet to experience anything terrible.

Many of bathrooms have been remodeled, the basement is now a great red color, you can watch the concert at almost any bar via closed circuit television and they opened the penthouse lounge, which is absolutely gorgeous during the summer!  It's a great building and it's unique in the Midwest, I look forward to see what they change next!After reading many reviews on here, I feel like most people would have avoided their frustrations had they been prepared.  If I'm attending a place I have never been before, especially a concert venue, I always Google or call to find out what I need to get my tickets and if I need cash beforehand.

Updated review","Food was bland and bag was soaking in grease when delivered. I used to really like this place but the prices have gotten so high and the portions have gotten so much smaller that I cant justify this place as my go-to anymore. The staff was always good and it's a nice environment overall, but my Shepard's Pie had so little flavor and veggies that I ended up seasoning it at home. The lamb was gamey as well, which is something I've never experienced with lamb before. The veggies were a big draw for me as well, but I seldom found a piece. Also, I had no clue it was topped with cheese (I don't handle dairy well so that's why I ordered it) so that was a turn off as well. Ugh.",133,678,Grace D.,"Brookfield, WI",0,116,45,0

I had a lot of fun both times! The environment, the crowd, the drinks, and the karaoke selection were all great. However, I went with a few friends last night and experienced a complete 180. The karaoke DJ was still great, but everyone else in the bar... Man, be careful. If you go for karaoke on Sundays, here are a couple tips. 1) Don't try to sing along with those at the mic! They won't consider it a compliment; they'll consider it a challenge. And I'm not talking American Idol kind of challenge, like you sing then I try to sing better. More of the glare from across the bar and harass you and make you feel uncomfortable and unsafe because for whatever reason, they don't like you. That kind of challenge. I can't remember the last time I felt that much animosity from total strangers in public. All because we were singing along and they thought we were mocking them. 2) Use cash. That way, if you need to get out, you can do so immediately. It took forever to close out our tab, mostly because one of the bartenders simply refused out of wanting to be an asshole to us. There was definitely a homophobic and sexist vibe to this bar. Which is disappointing because I really wanted to make it my new karaoke spot!",251,1345,Kip B.,"Milwaukee, WI",16,2,0,0

That would be an insult to stars. But I have to (thanks Yelp).The Highbury represents all that is dark and evil in the world. I'm fairly certain ISIS hates Americans because they stopped here for about five seconds. The bar, upon entering, emits the rancidness you'd expect from your toilet the day after a Taco Bell binge combined with the sweaty armpit of Lyle Alzado minutes after smashing a car on his worst 'roid rage night. If I was allowed to define ""pungent"" in the dictionary, I would say it's ""the best case scenario at the Highbury on a Saturday morning"". Speaking of Saturday mornings... if you like Futbol, and I do, this place will be open to come and endure the game. Note, I didn't say ""enjoy"" the game, and I barely said ""watch"" the game. The air of shame coming from the clientele for lowering their standards to drink here and watch soccer, combined with the tight spaces and sardine-can quality of how many people they pack in leads me to head straight to the nearest bidet to wash the musky goo off my bottom from all the man-junk pressed against me when so many people are pushing forward toward the bar to buy the over-priced rail drinks and Campbell's Tomato Soup Bloody Mary's. Psychologists must make a fortune from the mental health issues coming from all the people who've had to walk through the gauntlet of turgid Manchester United fans after they score a goal. Thankfully that's a rare occasion this season.  I'm pretty sure when you order a Miller Lite here in a bottle, you get the tiny leavings of a hundred previous customer's bottles all funneled into yours with a topper of seltzer to give it bubbles. I have no proof of this, but let me just say the Miller Lite here makes Natty Ice taste like Dom Perignon. The ATM in the bar is a joke and a half too. With fees like that, you'd think the bar owner is getting a major kickback per transaction, or works for the ATM company, or both. Speaking of the bar owner, I don't think I've met a more incorrigible self-righteous asshat in my life. I think he's been sober once in his life, and that was because there's no booze in amniotic fluid. Usually he's stumbling around his domain, scratching his little bits, and muttering about how ""back in the day when he had hair"" business was much better. Don't get me started on the bartenders. I thought this was a service industry, boy was I mistaken. This Scottish tosser was there slinging drinks... to his buddies... and essentially ignored everyone else. Let me correct myself, ""ignored"" would have been an upgrade to the treatment I fell victim to. I ordered a bottle of beer with a pop off top, and instead of using the bottle opener, he threw the bottle at my head and said SOMETHING in that godawful accent of his that I THINK translated to ""USE YOUR HANDS AND MAKE THEM BLEED IF YOU WANT TO DRINK IT!"" Which, when your breath reeks of haggis, really just adds to the aroma. I may quit drinking thanks to this place. Or even worse, I may buy two bottles of Malort, sit in a corner and guzzle them down until I can't remember ever having been there. It's Malort, so it will be hell, but at least not the lowest circle this bar spawned from.",591,3229,Brad K.,"Bay View, Milwaukee, WI",52,2,0,1

When the food was being delivered, our waitress attempted to reach the plate over my head and hit me in the face with the plate. This resulted in immediate bleeding at the base of my nose and later bruising and swelling. After this happened, the waitress just said, ""He turned into it,"" and walked away without apologizing. I figured a supervisor would come check on me, but no supervisor until I went and found one (after getting the bleeding to stop). The supervisor had me leave my information, and I figured a general manger would call me the following day and at least say sorry. Three days later, no call. Felt like they really didn't care they injured someone at their restaurant. And who reaches a plate over someone's head like that when they are looking the other way? At least say excuse me or something!",158,874,Matt T.,"Milwaukee, WI",1,98,13,1

The food was tasty, even though our experience was a NIGHTMARE and they didn't serve us some things as they were described in the menu.Let me be very clear: THE WHOLE NIGHT WAS SNAFU AFTER SNAFU AND IT WAS ALL THE FAULT OF THE MANAGER ON DUTY.Our server MAKAYLA was amazing and did her best to mitigate the screw-ups of the rest of the floor team and the poor management. First: they didn't have the beer I ordered nor the that of another in our party but took two trips back to the table to tell us both. The runner entered my drink in wrong and I was served the wrong beer. I didn't end up getting the right drink until well after our appetizer was served. Another person in our party did not get her drink until after me and they had what she wanted in stock. By this point we've been helped by 3 different people. We have also had 2 other people stop to ask if we ordered the food they were carrying around aimlessly.I ordered the 2lbs of mussels and fries. Mussels, fries and beer go together. My mussels came out a solid 15min or so before anyone else's food. My fries did not arrive until about 10min after even that. So I was without a crucial part of my meal experience for 25min, long enough for my mussels to cool down and detract greatly from the experience. They brought me a third pound of mussels with my order of two pounds, which I pointed out I did not order. They took the extra mussels after maybe 10 minutes then brought them back before the fries got there and said I could have them. There was a stark contrast in quality between that third pound and the first two, I speculate that the first pound had sat out under lamps for longer or something. Up to this point another 3 runners have stopped by our table to ask us if we ordered the food they were carrying. We were also delivered another incorrect drink.Next, when the rest of the party's food arrived, yet another runner was carrying the plates haphazardly and literally dumped a bowl of tomato soup onto the table which then splashed everywhere, into our drinks, onto our food, all over the table and worst, onto our clothes. The runner and server grabbed some handfuls of flimsy napkins, handed them to us and walked away for us to clean up ourselves after they made a few superficial swipes at the bulk of the mess. They left soup all over the table , see pics for the umbrella pole covered in it. Our drinks were ruined with tomato soup so I requested replacements to which they agreeably obliged, yet we didn't receive them until after 3 additional requests and well after our food was finished. The server MAKAYLA was extremely apologetic and was obviously mortified at the horrible performance of her management and team. She brought the manager up to us to address our experience. He immediately the all his staff under the bus when this is clearly a managerial issue. This man was not running his floor. He offered to reimburse us for dry-cleaning costs and a $30 comp on our $150(+tax and tip) cheque. We declined the dry-cleaning reimbursement as we don't live in the area. When our cheque arrived, we were charged for the replacement drinks and had to wait another 15min to clear that up. I am willing to give this place another shot despite all this because the atmosphere and food were good. We all have bad days, especially when the manager is not on his shit. I hope someone sees this and reprimands that manager, especially as he just threw his staff under the bus instead of taking responsibility for his poor management.",651,3556,Baron V.,"Livermore, CA",794,49,5,1

During my recent visit, I had the pleasure of trying their Blood Orange Mule and Turkey Pesto Sandwich, and I must say, it was a fantastic culinary experience.Let's start with the Blood Orange Mule, a refreshing and unique twist on the classic cocktail. The combination of tangy blood orange and zesty ginger beer created a delightful burst of flavors that perfectly complemented the smooth vodka. It was a fantastic choice for a refreshing beverage, and I found myself ordering more than one throughout my meal.Moving on to the Turkey Pesto Sandwich, I was blown away by the fantastic combination of ingredients. The tender slices of turkey were perfectly paired with a generous spread of flavorful pesto, adding a delightful herbaceous touch. The sandwich was further elevated by the addition of fresh lettuce, juicy tomatoes, and creamy provolone cheese, all enclosed in a perfectly toasted bread. Each bite was a harmonious blend of textures and flavors, leaving me thoroughly satisfied.Aside from the outstanding food and beverages, Cafe Benelux also deserves praise for its charming ambiance. The cafe's cozy interior, with its warm lighting and comfortable seating, creates a welcoming and relaxed atmosphere. The staff members were friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable, adding to the overall enjoyable dining experience.In conclusion, if you find yourself in Cafe Benelux, don't miss out on the Blood Orange Mule and the Turkey Pesto Sandwich. These menu items showcase the cafe's commitment to quality ingredients and culinary expertise. With its inviting atmosphere and delicious offerings, Cafe Benelux is definitely worth a visit for anyone looking for a delightful meal in a cozy setting.",286,1832,Maggie G.,"Milwaukee, WI",10,27,18,1
